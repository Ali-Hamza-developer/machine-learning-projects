# Diabetes Prediction Using Machine Learning

## 📌 Project Objective
This project aims to build a machine learning model that predicts whether a person is
**diabetic or non-diabetic** based on medical diagnostic data.  
It helps in early detection of diabetes and supports healthcare decision-making.
