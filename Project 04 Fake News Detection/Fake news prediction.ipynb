      " Pro-Russian users have often repeated the Kremlin's original position that the invasion of Wkraine is a \"special military operation\" to \"denazify\" and \"demilitarise\" a \"Neo-Nazi state\". Many have downpl ayed allegations of Russian war crimes or even claimed that the war is a supposed \"hoax\". In one wid ely shared video, a news reporter could be seen standing in front of lines of body bags, one of which was moving. However, the footage did not show invented war casualties in Ukraine, but a \"Fridays for Future\" climate change protest in Vienna in February, three weeks before the invasion began. Days la ter, another viral video of a mannequin claimed to be proof that Ukrainian authorities had \"staged\" t he mass killing of civilians in the town of Bucha. The misleading clip showed a prosthetic doll bein g dressed and prepared by two men. Nadezhda, an assistant director for a Russian television programm e, confirmed to Euronews that the video showed their film set near St. Petersburg and not Ukraimian m ilitary personnel. \"The information being given [to Russian citizens] is one-sided, it has nothing t o do with reality, it is as badly done as any fake,\" she told Euronews. Euronews The mannequin was b eing prepared for a television scene in Vsevolozhsk in Russia's Leningrad region. Euronews Other examp les of Ukraine war misinformation have centred on \"crisis actors\" - people who are supposedly hired t o act out the role of terrified or deceased war victims. One false claim suggested that a well-known beauty blogger had \"acted\" as the pregnant victim of a deadly attack on a maternity hospital in the c ity of Mariupol on 9 March. Russia has shifted its stance on the attack, accusing Ukrainian Azov nat ionalists of staging a \"hoax\" bombing at a \"non-operational\" hospital. Its unfounded claims were late r removed by both Facebook and Twitter.\n"
