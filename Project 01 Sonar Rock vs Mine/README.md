# Sonar Rock vs Mine Classification

## 📌 Project Description
This project implements a machine learning classification system to predict whether an object detected by sonar signals is a rock or a mine. The model is trained using supervised learning techniques on a labeled sonar dataset.

## 🎯 Objective
To build a predictive model that accurately classifies sonar signal data into two categories:
- Rock (R)
- Mine (M)

## 🧠 Techniques Used
- Data preprocessing
- Train-test split
- Supervised learning classification model
- Model evaluation and prediction
